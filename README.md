## Project Description

In this project, you will think of a topic and problem, collect experimental data, complete an end-to-end analysis and present the results, all by yourself.

First, choose a topic of interest to you and understand what research has already been done in that area. What are some interesting questions that remain? Can you turn those questions into a product (i.e. can you extract value out of answering those questions)?

You will then collect some data you think could help answer those questions. Choose your main source of data wisely, since in this project you have a restriction that tries to emulate a common corporate setting: you won't have access to a census of the universe of your choice. You must collect the data yourself in such a way that the universe of datapoints available to you is limted. For example, you may be limited by time (e.g. watching and categorizing Youtube videos or Instagram pictures), by cost (e.g. querying Google Maps for public transport routes via the gui, without paying for the API access) or by access (e.g. surveying people on their preferences). In the end, you should aim at collecting between 30 and 100 observations (rows) and between 5 and 10 features (columns) per observation.

Once you have your data, complete an analysis that answers your original question and/or related ancilliary questions. Please make sure that the main observations you make hold to scientific scrutiny at some level of significance. You can and should supplement your analysis with visual intuition and highlights of hypothesis that the data seems to support, even if you are not necessarily able to hold those insights to the same level of scrutiny as your main question.

You can enrich your limited dataset with information from richer sources that you can obtain trough any means you've learned before (e.g. you may web scrape the weights of car models if that is one of your observations).

Like in the previous project, package your results with a product or service mindset. You will present your findings in a presentation (possibly supported by an interactive visualization or even a flask app) where you should evidence principles of dashboarding and storytelling.
